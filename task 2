Task1:

compiler :
	translates the whole pgm
	execution time is faster
	Display all errors after compilation
	lang uses compiler: c,c++,java
	
Interpreter :
	translates a stmt of pgm at a time
	execution time is slower
	Displays all errors of each line one by one
	lang uses interpreter : PHP,Ruby

Task2:

rules for creating variable in python
	
	must start with a letter or _
	cannot start with a num
	contains only alpha numeric characters and _
	keywords cannot be used as variables

Task3:

difference between python 2 and python 3 version

python 2:

	print"stmt"
	when dividing 2 integers the ans will be an integer value
	ITERATIONS -> xrange()
	Exceptions -> should be enclosed in notations

python 3:

	print("stmt")
	when dividing 2 integers the ans will be a float value
	ITERATIONS -> new range()
	Exceptions -> should be enclosed in parenthesis


Task4:

Complex data type in python

	a+bj
	syntax:complex(real part+ imag. part)

Task5:

prime number     -> num which is divided by 1 or itself only
factorial        -> multiply the given number with the lesser numbers below them till 1
fibonacci series -> series of no.s in which each num is the sum of previous 2 no.s
Armstrong number -> a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits
odd/even/positive/negative
complex number   -> a num that contains real and imaginary parts
palindrome       -> a word which is the same when it reads from forward as well as backward
anagram          -> a word or sentence formed by rearranging the given word / sentence
